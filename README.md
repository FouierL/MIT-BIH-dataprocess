因为项目需要读取这个数据库的心电数据，就在matlab写了这段代码，说明文件已经附在了目录下，还有画出来的图片（当然画图的代码可以修改，画出更好看的图）
Because the project needs to read the ECG data of this database, I wrote this code in MATLAB, indicating that the file has been attached to the directory, as well as the drawn picture (of course, the code of drawing can be modified to draw a better picture)
当然，数据集需要去原本网站下载，我没有转载数据库的权利
Of course, the dataset needs to be downloaded from the original website, and I do not have the right to reprint the database
